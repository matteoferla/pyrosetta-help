Basic example:

    add_bfactor_from_consurf(med27, 'Consurf_Outputs_1606141517/consurf.grades')
    
Chain is A in consurf but V in pose example:

    conscores = read_conscores('Consurf_Outputs_1606141517/consurf.grades')
    remap_conscores_chains(conscores, {'A': 'V'})
    add_bfactors_from_conscores(pose, conscores)
        
## PyMOL

b-factor putty preset is in rainbow. This is a better option:

    cartoon putty
    spectrum b, blue_white_red
    color atomic, not element C
    
Alternatively, if not for publication green to red may be better: `green_white_red`.

To disable putty:

    cartoon automatic
    color atomic
